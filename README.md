# 🐍 Broken Python 🐍

> A code-inspired twist on the classic Snake game, built for the Boot.dev Hackathon 2025.

In this educational arcade experience, our hungry python slithers through code mazes collecting valid Python keywords — while dodging imposters, errors, and a very grumpy compiler. 
Each level teaches a new concept from `print()` to loops and functions.

## 🧠 Game Features

- 🐍 **Keyword-Focused Levels**  
  Learn or rather revise Python basics in 5 structured levels.

- ⚡ **Code Console Mechanics**  
  Bump into the console if you've picked the wrong keyword.

- 🤖 **Chase Mode (Final Level)**  
  Race against a bugged enemy snake that hunts you down in the final level.

- 🔊 **Sound & Music FX**  
  Passable music and audio, but hey, it's there.

- 🎨 **Pixel Art Snake Sprites**  
  Snake sprites were designed manually on Piskel cos vibe generating transparent PNGs was nearly impossible. Possible skill issue.
