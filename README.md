# 🐍 Python Learns Keywords 🐍

> A code-inspired twist on the classic Snake game, built for the Boot.dev Hackathon 2025.

In this educational arcade experience, our hungry python slithers through code mazes collecting valid Python keywords—while dodging imposters, errors, and a very grumpy compiler. Each level teaches a new concept from `print()` to loops and functions.
